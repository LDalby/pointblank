  agent,
  name = NULL,
  path = NULL,
  overwrite = FALSE,
  make_read_only = TRUE,
  skip_on_cran = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{agent}{An agent object of class \code{ptblank_agent}.}

\item{name}{An optional name for for the \strong{testhat} test file. This should
be a name without extension and without the leading \code{"test-"} text. If
nothing is supplied, the name will be derived from the \code{tbl_name} in the
agent. If that's not present, a generic name will be used.}

\item{path}{A path can be specified here if there shouldn't be an attempt to
place the file in \code{testthat/tests}.}

\item{overwrite}{Should a \strong{testthat} file of the same name be overwritten?
By default, this is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{make_read_only}{Should the file to be written be read only? If \code{TRUE}
(the default), it will be read-only and text at the top of the file will
indicate this.}

\item{skip_on_cran}{This option will include a \code{\link[testthat:skip]{testthat::skip_on_cran()}}
call at the top of the file to avoid running the data validation test on
CRAN.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns \code{TRUE} if the \strong{testthat} file has been written.
}
\description{
With a \strong{pointblank} \emph{agent}, we can write a \strong{testthat} test file and opt
to place it in the \code{testthat/tests} if it is available in the project path
(we can specify an alternate path as well). This works by transforming the
validation steps to a series of \verb{expect_*()} calls inside individual
\code{\link[testthat:test_that]{testthat::test_that()}} statements.
