\title{Get a summary report using multiple agents}
\usage{
get_multiagent_report(multiagent, display_table = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{multiagent}{A multiagent object of class \code{ptblank_multiagent}.}

\item{display_table}{Should a display table be generated? If \code{TRUE} (the
default) a display table for the report will be shown in the Viewer. If
\code{FALSE} then a tibble will be returned.}
}
\value{
A \strong{gt} table object if \code{display_table = TRUE} or a tibble if
\code{display_table = FALSE}.
}
\description{
We can get an informative summary table from a collective of agents by using
the \code{get_multiagent_report()} function. The table can be provided in either
of two very different forms: as a \strong{gt} based display table (the default),
or, as a tibble with packed columns. The display table variant of the
multiagent report, the default form, will have the following columns:

\itemize{
\item STEP: the SHA1 hash for the validation step, possibly shared among
several interrogations.
\item \emph{subsequent columns}: each column beyond \code{STEP} represents a separate
interrogation from an \emph{agent} object. The time stamp for the completion of
each interrogation is shown as the column label.
}

Each step is represented with an icon standing in for the name of the
validation function and the associated SHA1 hash. This is a highly
trustworthy way for ascertaining which validation steps are effectively
identical across interrogations. This way of organizing the report is
beneficial because different agents may have used different steps and we want
to track the validation results where the validation step doesn't change but
the target table does.
