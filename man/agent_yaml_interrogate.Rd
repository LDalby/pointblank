\title{Read a YAML file to interrogate a target table immediately}
\usage{
agent_yaml_interrogate(path)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{A path to a YAML file that specifies a validation plan for an
\emph{agent}.}
}
\description{
The \code{agent_yaml_interrogate()} function operates much like the
\code{\link[=agent_yaml_read]{agent_yaml_read()}} function (reading a \strong{pointblank} YAML file and
generating an \emph{agent} with a validation plan in place). The key difference is
that this function takes things a step function and interrogates the target
table (defined by table-reading, \code{read_fn}, function that is required in the
YAML file). The additional invocation of \code{\link[=interrogate]{interrogate()}} uses the default
options of that function. As with \code{\link[=agent_yaml_read]{agent_yaml_read()}} the agent is returned
except, this time, it has intel from the interrogation.
