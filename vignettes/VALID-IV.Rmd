### Introduction to the **Data Tests for Conditionals** Workflow (**VALID-IV**)

The *VALID-IV: Data Tests for Conditionals* workflow is probably not much of a workflow really. But maybe you consider programming and control flow a sort of workflow. If that's the case and you are programming with data, the functions of this workflow might be useful for that. A set of `test_*()` functions, with the same options as the `expect_*()` functions of *VALID-III*, are used with data tables and the result of each call returns a single logical value (`TRUE` or `FALSE`).
